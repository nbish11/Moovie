00:00:09.115 --> 00:00:10.180
Are you Jake Sully?

2
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.220
I'd like to talk to you about a fresh start, on a new world.

3
00:00:16.915 --> 00:00:18.280
You'd be making a difference.

4
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.800
I became a marine for the hardship.

5
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.580
I told myself I could pass
any test a man can pass.

6
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.600
All I ever wanted was a single thing worth fighting for.

7
00:00:31.805 --> 00:00:32.543
Ladies and gentlemen...

8
00:00:34.745 --> 00:00:37.243
you are not in Kansas any more.

9
00:00:38.043 --> 00:00:39.506
You are on Pandora.

10
00:00:40.676 --> 00:00:41.855
You should see your faces.

11
00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:45.307
We have an indigenous population called the Na'vi.

12
00:00:46.022 --> 00:00:47.685
They are very hard to kill.

13
00:00:48.547 --> 00:00:49.599
This is why we're here.

14
00:00:50.145 --> 00:00:52.990
Because this little grey rock sells for twenty million a kilo.

15
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.680
Their village happens to be resting on the richest deposit,

16
00:00:56.755 --> 00:00:57.780
and they need to relocate.

17
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.124
Those savages are threatening our whole operation.

18
00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:05.800
We're on the brink of war and you're supposed to be finding a diplomatic solution.

19
00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:12.000
The concept is to drive these remotely controlled bodies, called avatars.

20
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.488
They're grown from human DNA... Mixed with DNA of the natives.

21
00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:19.664
A marine, in an avatar body.

22
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.350
That's a potent mix.

23
00:01:21.892 --> 00:01:24.971
You get me what I need, I'll see to it you get your legs back...

24
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.720
Your real legs.

25
00:01:26.785 --> 00:01:27.546
Hell yeah, Sir.

26
00:01:27.843 --> 00:01:28.847
Looks like you.

27
00:01:29.552 --> 00:01:30.839
This is your avatar.

28
00:01:31.894 --> 00:01:33.822
Just relax and let your mind go blank.

29
00:01:34.892 --> 00:01:36.481
That shouldn't be hard for you.

30
00:01:49.868 --> 00:01:52.126
Jake, it's real simple...

31
00:01:53.813 --> 00:01:57.791
I want you to learn from the inside, I want you to gain their trust.

32
00:02:02.014 --> 00:02:03.278
You should not be here.

33
00:02:04.974 --> 00:02:05.519
Go back!

34
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.079
All this is your fault.

35
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.579
I need your help.

36
00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:19.422
Outstanding.

37
00:02:24.838 --> 00:02:26.837
Haven't gotten lost in the woods, have you?

38
00:02:27.532 --> 00:02:29.291
Did you forget what team you're playing for?

39
00:02:31.082 --> 00:02:32.160
The strong prey on the weak...

40
00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:33.722
And nobody does a thing.

41
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.179
You've got one hour.

42
00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:37.188
You knew this would happen?

43
00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:38.522
Everything changed.

44
00:02:39.822 --> 00:02:40.800
Jake, it's crazy here.

45
00:02:41.235 --> 00:02:43.594
Quaritch is rolling and there's no stopping him.

46
00:02:44.585 --> 00:02:47.384
We're going up against gunships with bows and arrows.

47
00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:48.999
Then I guess we'd better stop him.

48
00:03:04.487 --> 00:03:05.666
They've sent us a message...

49
00:03:06.164 --> 00:03:07.943
That they can take whatever they want.

50
00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:10.437
Well we will send them a message...

51
00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.617
That this...

52
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.317
This is our land!
